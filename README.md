# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I crave knowledge; and the task to build a webpage allowed me to learn basic coding. As soon as I started building the webpage, I could not stop because I wanted to see the final project.
- I built this webpage because I knew I was going to have a better understanding of HTML, CSS, GIt, and JavaScript.
- After completeing this project, I feel more confident and comfortable working with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- From the beginning to the end, I made many mistakes, even starting over once. I'm glad I made mistakes because it tested my knowledge and allowed me to fix my mistakes on my own.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide webpage has notes explaining about the HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The HTML notes only talk about what's written on the page and the CSS notes only talk about the styling of the page. The Git notes are git commands one uses when working on different issues. And the JavaScript notes explains some functions about JavaScript. However, Javascript is best portrayed by accessing the DevTools console.
